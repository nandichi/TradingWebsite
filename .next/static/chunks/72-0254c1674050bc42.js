Instead of traditional technical analysis, you learn how 'smart money' (banks, hedge funds, institutional traders) influences the market and how you can profit from these movements by understanding concepts like liquidity, order blocks, and fair value gaps."},{id:"suitable-for-whom",question:"Who is this suitable for?",answer:"This mentorship is suitable for both beginners and experienced traders who want to learn about institutional trading concepts. You don't need prior knowledge, but you do need discipline, patience, and the willingness to invest time in learning and practicing. It's not suitable for people looking for 'quick wins' or guaranteed profits."},{id:"profitable-after-month",question:"Will I be profitable after one month?",answer:"There are no guarantees in trading. The goal of the mentorship is to give you the right knowledge, tools, and mindset for long-term success. Some students see results within weeks, others need months. The focus is on learning a sustainable process and risk management, not on quick profits."},{id:"recordings-available",question:"Do I get recordings and replay options?",answer:"Yes, all group sessions and livestreams are recorded and available for replay. For 1-on-1 sessions, recordings are also made upon request. You get access to a private portal with all materials, recordings, and resources."},{id:"broker-recommendations",question:"Which brokers or exchanges do you recommend?",answer:"I don't give specific broker recommendations because this is personal and depends on your location, capital, and preferences. However, you'll learn how to evaluate brokers yourself on factors like spreads, regulation, reliability, and platforms. Always doing your own research is essential."},{id:"time-commitment",question:"How much time should I invest per week?",answer:"For optimal results, I recommend at least 5-10 hours per week: attending sessions, doing homework, practicing chart analysis, and journaling. The more time you invest, the faster you'll see progress. Quality is more important than quantity."},{id:"schedule-intake",question:"How do I schedule an intake call?",answer:"Click on 'Schedule an intake' and you'll be directed to my Calendly page where you can schedule a free 15-minute introduction call. We'll discuss your goals, experience, and whether the mentorship is right for you. No obligations, just an open conversation about your trading ambitions."},{id:"financial-advice",question:"Is this financial advice?",answer:"No, this is educational only. All content, sessions, and materials are intended for educational purposes. I don't give financial advice and am not a registered financial advisor. You are responsible for your own trading decisions and any losses."},{id:"group-size",question:"How big are the groups?",answer:"Group mentorship groups are deliberately kept small (maximum 8-10 people) to guarantee personal attention. This ensures everyone can ask questions and receive individual feedback on trades and analyses."},{id:"refund-policy",question:"What is the refund policy?",answer:"I offer a 7-day money-back guarantee for all programs. If you're not satisfied after the first week, you get your money back in full. This gives you the chance to experience whether the approach suits you without financial risk."},{id:"technical-requirements",question:"What are the technical requirements?",answer:"You need a computer or laptop with a stable internet connection for video calls. For chart analysis, you can use free platforms like TradingView. Specific software recommendations and setup help are provided during the first sessions."},{id:"support-availability",question:"When are you available for support?",answer:"For 1-on-1 students, I'm available for DM support during office hours (9:00-17:00 CET, Monday-Friday). Group mentorship students can reach out in the community chat and during group sessions. Response time is usually within 24 hours."}];var h=t(6936);function p(e){let{maxItems:n}=e,t=n?m.slice(0,n):m;return(0,a.jsx)("section",{className:"py-20 px-4",children:(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"container max-w-4xl",children:[(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"text-center mb-16",children:[(0,a.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-4",children:"Frequently asked questions"}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{className:"text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto",children:"Answers to the most frequently asked questions about our mentorship programs"})]}),(0,a.jsx)(h.E.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:20},whileInView:{opacity:1,y:0},viewport:{once:!0},transition:{duration:.8},children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{type:"single",collapsible:!0,className:"space-y-4",children:t.map((e,n)=>(0,a.jsx)(h.E.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:20},whileInView:{opacity:1,y:0},viewport:{once:!0},transition:{duration:.5,delay:.1*n},children:(0,a.jsxs)(c,{value:e.id,className:"border rounded-lg px-6 bg-card hover:shadow-sm transition-shadow",children:[(0,a.jsx)(d,{className:"text-left font-medium hover:no-underline",children:e.question}),(0,a.jsx)(u,{className:"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed",children:e.answer})]})},e.id))})})]})})}},5754:function(e,n,t){t.d(n,{z:function(){return c}});var a=t(7437),r=t(2265),i=t(7256),o=t(6061),s=t(1657);let l=(0,o.j)("inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",{variants:{variant:{default:"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",destructive:"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",outline:"border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",secondary:"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",ghost:"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",link:"text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline"},size:{default:"h-10 px-4 py-2",sm:"h-9 rounded-md px-3",lg:"h-11 rounded-md px-8",icon:"h-10 w-10"}},defaultVariants:{variant:"default",size:"default"}}),c=r.forwardRef((e,n)=>{let{className:t,variant:r,size:o,asChild:c=!1,...d}=e,u=c?i.g7:"button";return(0,a.jsx)(u,{className:(0,s.cn)(l({variant:r,size:o,className:t})),ref:n,...d})});c.displayName="Button"},6257:function(e,n,t){t.d(n,{J:function(){return a}});let a={title:"Aaron Haden — Crypto Mentorship",tagline:"Learn 1-on-1 trading with Smart Money Concepts",description:"Get structure, clarity, and guidance from mentor Aaron Haden.
